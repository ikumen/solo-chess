# Solo Chess

A [Flutter-based](https://flutter.dev) chess puzzle app inspired by [Thinkfun's Solitaire Chess](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/brain-fitness-solitaire-chess/).
I wrote it as a side project while learning Flutter, plus we have the physical game at home and the kids thought an app version would be great.
